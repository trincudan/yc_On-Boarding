## Gallery Organizer

1. Create a script that will populate a directory called gallery with 1000 random files as follows:
- they have random creation times in the past year
- random extensions are added from the next choices .png, jpg, .gif and .jpeg

2. Create a second script that will oraganize the gallery by moving all the files in a new folder called gallery_organized
- there will be 4 subfolders with the name of the file extension (png,jpg,gif and jpeg)
- files will be moved in the dedicated subfolder based on their extension

3. The files will be moved in dedicated subfolders based on the file creation date. Only year and month will be considered. Example
oranized_gallery
- png
- -202101
- - 202102
- - 202103

4. Put the scripts to run over a schedule. Enhance the 2nd script not to overwrite existing files in the gallery_organized folder."
